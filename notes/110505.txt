h3. numbers

h3. strings

* strings are a sequence of characters; behave as lists
* strings = immutable 

h3. tuples
* ()
* immutable lists
* moetly read-only methods, since they're immutable
* lists of heterogeneous things

* mutable
* list(item) will convert a string to a list, then works with list methods, like sort, etc.

h3. dictionaries

* {}
* associative arrays, key => value
* mutable, unordered 

h2. exercises

* pg = (paragraph)
* word frequency: pg.count('the') => 6
* words in story: len(pg.split(' ')) => 78
* letter count: pglist = list(pg); len(pglist) => 422
* Replace all instances of "he" with "He": pg.replace('he', 'He') => but this does all occurrences of he, so it's not right
* sorted alphapetically: sorted(pg_replace) => but this lists capitals first
* sort by word length: 


h2. notes

* pydoc and help(thing) to check methods
* cool kids say __ is "dunder"
* hash() function
