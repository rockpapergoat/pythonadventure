h3. features
* field to log whether book is in, out, lost, destroyed
* tack on datestamp to list entry when adding a book
** use this both as id and record of when added


h3. notes
* list.append() works fine for adding to end of list
* could probably also use list.insert(), though that adds to the beginning
