h3. code


h3. notes

looking over sample code, i basically understand what's going on but am having a difficult time thinking "pythonically" so far.

* method(self, arg) used for instance methods within classes
* calls self behind the scenes
* practice working with core data types. inline help is clunky, and methods feel awkward to me
* separate inputs and outputs to keep methods clean
* code testing: how?
